                    Thank you for your interest in my locally based Female Veteran-owned and operated Small Business

                    To place an order through the website, for local delivery, or for mail orders to North Carolina,
                    please refer to our menu page for current inventory and prices, complete the order form, and give us
                    30 minutes to generate and send out your Square invoice. If you'd like to receive a payable Square
                    invoice to your phone via text, instead of by email, please do not opt out of receiving updates or
                    other "future text communications" from Square, as this prevents any businesses utilizing Square
                    from being able to send a Square invoice via text message to that particular phone number.
